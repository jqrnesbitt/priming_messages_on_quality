# The Effects of Subliminal Priming on Quality of Work

This repo is for the final project submission for W241. Here we explore the effects of subliminal priming on work quality. Within this report we do the following:

 - Deployed an experiment on Linkedin which randomly assigned individuals to treatment and control
 - Performed EDA and identified areas with data quality issues
 - Calculated attrition, noncompliance and spillover
 - Developed 4 causal models
